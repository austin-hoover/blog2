    "text": "1. Collective effects in particle accelerators\nAn accelerator is a machine that produces beams of charged particles and directs them to a target. The products of the resulting collision can unveil the internal structure of the target. A large range of spatial and temporal scales can be probed by tuning the beam parameters — the energy, charge density, time structure, particle species, etc. Thus, accelerators are important experimental tools in many fields, including elementary particle physics, nuclear physics, condensed matter physics, material science, chemistry, and biology.\nAccelerator physics aims to understand, predict, measure, and control the behavior of charged particle beams. We can divide this effort into three main categories: (1) increasing the beam energy, (2) increasing the beam intensity (the total number of particles), and (3) increasing the beam brightness (the particle density in position-momentum space). My research is currently focused on increasing hadron beam intensity. Intense hadron beams have applications ranging from particle physics to nuclear energy production.\nThe beam intensity in an accelerator is limited by the number of particles that do not survive their journey to the target. We call these lost particles. Losses lead to damage and radio-activation of the accelerator components. If the radiation is too high, hands-on maintenance is unsafe and the accelerator cannot operate. It is at first not obvious why any beam loss should occur. Accelerators are carefully designed so that each particle performs stable oscillations about a reference trajectory. But these designs are based on single-particle tracking through linear electromagnetic fields; in reality, nonlinear fields exist and the beam is comprised of billions or trillions of interacting particles. These collective effects are particularly difficult to predict.\nThere are two main collective effects to consider. First, relativistic charged particles generate electromagnetic wake fields. When these wake fields interact with the environment (i.e., the conducting vacuum chamber), they can affect other particles in the beam (or the same particle on subsequent turns in a circular machine). This feedback loop can cause unstable dipole oscillations of the entire beam. Second, particles interact directly via Coloumb forces, also known as space charge forces. When coupled with the periodic electromagnetic fields in the accelerator (linear or nonlinear), space charge forces can lead to chaotic phase space trajectories and large-amplitude excursions of single particles. The resulting beam loss can be problematic even if very small relative to the total beam intensity."

    "section": "2. Predicting halo formation in linacs",
    "text": "2. Predicting halo formation in linacs\nThe magnitude of the space charge force depends inversely on the beam energy. Thus, space charge is strongest during the early stages of acceleration in a linear accelerator (linac), near the particle source. The dynamics are complicated in this stage. One well-known and persistent phenomenon is the emergence of beam halo — a low-density region of position-momentum space (phase space) far from the dense beam core. Halo particles are very likely to be lost during transport due to their large amplitudes. Even a very low-density halo can cause unacceptable beam loss. The beam power deposited throughout the accelerator must be kept below one watt per meter along the beamline. Existing facilities operating with megawatts of beam power and losses on the order of \\(10^{-4}\\)-\\(10^{-6}\\) operate near this limit. If the beam power was increased by a factor of ten while fixing the fractional beam loss, the radio-activation in the linac would be too high.\nSince halo particles occupy very low-density regions of phase space, their evolution is difficult to predict. Beam loss patterns in large linear accelerators cannot be reproduced in simulations, and even attempts to predict halo formation over short distances have failed. Although the relevant physics is assumed to be modeled correctly in simulation codes, there remain uncertainties in the simulation inputs — the electromagnetic fields throughout the accelerator and the initial particle distribution.\n[…]"

    "section": "1. The Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR)",
    "text": "1. The Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR)\nThe PSR can be used to run an argument for the existence of a necessary being. Here is the basic form of such an argument {% cite sep-cosmological-argument %}:\n\nA contingent being (a being such that if it exists, it could have not-existed) exists.\nAll contingent beings have a sufficient cause of or fully adequate explanation for their existence.\nThe sufficient cause of or fully adequate explanation for the existence of contingent beings is something other than the contingent being itself.\nThe sufficient cause of or fully adequate explanation for the existence of contingent beings must either be solely other contingent beings or include a non-contingent (necessary) being.\nContingent beings alone cannot provide a sufficient cause of or fully adequate explanation for the existence of contingent beings.\nTherefore, what sufficiently causes or fully adequately explains the existence of contingent beings must include a non-contingent (necessary) being.\nTherefore, a necessary being (a being such that if it exists, it cannot not-exist) exists.\nThe universe, which is composed of only contingent beings, is contingent.\nTherefore, the necessary being is something other than the universe.\n\nPremise 2 is the PSR. Oppy suggests that the PSR, as it is usually formulated, is unacceptably strong and that defensible versions of the PSR are “so weak that it is implausible to suppose that they possess serious metaphysical bite” {% cite Oppy2006-inf %}.{% fn 1 %} In this section, I will discuss several points raised by Pruss in {% cite Craig2009 %} in defense of the PSR.\n\n1.1. Support for the PSR\nThe PSR is a kind of rock-bottom principle that is difficult to arrive at from other principles; thus, one option is to accept the PSR in the absence of any cogent counterarguments. One argument for the PSR is that the denial of the PSR leads to extreme skepticism: if the PSR is false, then my sensory inputs could exist for no reason, meaning that I do not have any knowledge {% cite Koons2021 %}. And since to assign a probability is to explain a frequency in terms of an underlying regularity, no probability can be assigned to this scenario {% cite Craig2009 %}. We might go further and claim that the PSR is assumed whenever we scientifically inquire. Although there is debate about the fundamentality of causation in physics, it seems to me that physics is at least in search of explanations. If the PSR is false, then the following “explanation” is available for any fact: there is no explanation. Again, one might argue that there is no meaningful probability that can be assigned to this “explanation”.\n\n\n1.2. Objections to the PSR\nSurely, those who reject the PSR are doing so because they are skeptical of applying it to every contingent fact; if there is just one unexplained contingent fact, then the PSR is false. Therefore, one way to object to the PSR is to identify an unexplained, or potentially unexplained, fact.\n\n1.2.1. Imagination\nHume suggested that the PSR is false because one can imagine an exception to it. This objection is not so interesting to me, so I will move on.\n\n\n1.2.2. Chance\nQuantum mechanics leaves open the possibility of chancy — i.e., random — events {% cite Maudlin2014 %}.{% fn 2 %} If an event is chancy, then it seems that there is no explanation for it. This would violate the PSR.\nHowever, we might think that quantum events are not unexplained even if they are chancy: the laws of quantum mechanics + the system indeterministically produce — and thus explain — the measured state. This may be a less-than-ideal explanation since only patterns in groups of measurements are explained instead of individual measurements, but it is an explanation nonetheless; we are providing a background or framework on which the measurement is not surprising. (In {% cite Malpass2021YT %}, Alex Malpass notes that, in his opinion, it is an open question whether such an explanation is relevant to cosmological arguments.)\n\n\n1.2.3. Free will\nHere is Oppy’s definition of libertarian free will: “If an agent \\(X\\) acts freely in performing action \\(A\\) in circumstances \\(C\\) at time \\(T\\) in world \\(W\\), then it is not made true by the truth-making core of the world \\(W\\) prior to \\(T\\) that agent \\(X\\) will do \\(A\\) in circumstances \\(C\\).” In other words, there is a possible world that shares the same history as the actual world, but in which the agent acted differently. The PSR is false if there is no explanation for why one world was actualized instead of the other world.\nOne solution to this problem is to reject the libertarian conception of free will.{% fn 3 %} Another solution is to provide an explanation of libertarian free choices. We will have to resort to some sort of non-deterministic explanation, as in the previous section. Pruss presents a hypothesis in {% cite Craig2009 %} that I have reorganized/paraphrased below. (The terms in brackets can be exchanged with the preceding unbracketed terms in each line.)\n\nHypothesis: Free choices are made based on reasons that one is “impressed by”, i.e., that one takes into consideration in making the decision.\nSuppose agent \\(X\\) has a binary choice between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\nLet \\(S\\{T\\}\\) be a subset of the reasons that favor \\(A\\{B\\}\\) over \\(B\\{A\\}\\).\nIf \\(X\\) freely chooses \\(A\\{B\\}\\), it is because \\(X\\) is making a free choice between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) while impressed by the reasons in \\(S\\{T\\}\\); \\(X\\) is also impressed by \\(T\\{S\\}\\), but only acts on the impressive reasons in \\(S\\{T\\}\\). {% fn 4 %}\n\nMy initial thought is that it seems plausible for libertarian free choices to be explained in this way or a similar way. The strategy seems analogous to the previous attempt to explain chancy events.\n\n\n1.2.4. Modal fatalism\nSuppose that \\(C\\) is the conjunction of every contingent proposition and that \\(E\\) explains \\(C\\). \\(E\\) cannot be contingent because \\(C\\) would then contain \\(E\\) and \\(E\\) would explain itself, which is impossible; \\(E\\) cannot be necessary because a necessary proposition cannot explain a contingent proposition; \\(E\\) cannot exist.\nThis objection points out the difficulty in forming an explanatory link between the necessary and the contingent. Pruss pushes back in a few ways. First, in this objection, we have assumed that if \\(p\\) is necessary and \\(p\\) explains \\(q\\), then \\(p\\) entails \\(q\\). He suggests that there are counterexamples, such as statistical/non-deterministic explanations, and that our normal concept of explanation does not involve entailment. Second, he argues that the PSR survives if libertarian free will is possible and if God — a necessary being — freely chose to instantiate \\(C\\). The existence of God would then explain \\(C\\) without entailing \\(C\\).\nThere are several difficulties with this approach. One difficulty is that libertarian free will may be impossible. Another difficulty is that it may be the case that God’s choices are not contingent. Most theists maintain that God chose the actual world out of the possible worlds. For example, since God is morally perfect, it seems that God would not instantiate a world in which only evil occurred. In fact, it seems that God would instantiate the best possible world (I think there is debate about whether there is such a thing). The question is whether it is possible for God to have chosen differently. If it is not possible for God to have chosen differently, then maybe God’s choices are necessary, and therefore \\(C\\) is necessary. This would render the PSR false. I suspect this is just an attack on the idea of libertarian free will and that the theist can probably escape without harm.\n\n\n1.2.5. Infinite chains\nWe’re now going to switch gears and focus on infinite causal/explanatory chains.{% fn 5 %} Each element in the chain is explained by its predecessor — this is an internal explanation — but the question arises whether some external explanation is needed for the chain.{% fn 6 %}\nI’ve found that my intuitions change depending on whether the chain extends infinitely into the past. Let’s start with a chain that extends finitely into the past. Consider a particle \\(p_0\\) that comes into existence at time \\(t = 1\\) for no reason. Maybe we take issue with this. Now consider a particle \\(p_0\\) that exists at time \\(t = 1\\) and was created in the following way: for every integer \\(n \\ge 0\\), particle \\(p_{n + 1}\\) decayed into particle \\(p_{n}\\) at \\(t = 2^{-n}\\). Thus, there are an infinite number of causes within a finite time interval. Although the existence of each particle is explained by its parent, it will seem to many that the result is the same: the particle came into existence uncaused. Therefore, Pruss says, if we demand a cause for one particle, we should demand a cause for an infinite series of particles.\nHe then argues that our same intuitions should apply if the infinite number of causes are not squeezed into a finite time interval but are instead spread out over an infinite past. In other words, each cause in the interval (0, 1] is mapped to a negative time while preserving the ordering: \\(1 \\rightarrow 1\\), \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\rightarrow 0\\), \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\rightarrow -1\\), \\(\\frac{1}{8} \\rightarrow -2\\), \\(\\dots\\). It appears that nothing has changed, so we should either accept or reject the possibility of both scenarios.\nHowever, it is difficult to imagine what an external cause — a reason why the particles are not different particles, or shoes, or books, or why they exist at all — would look like since there is no first time. (The same can be said of the (0, 1] scenario if we assume that time began so that there is no time \\(t \\le 0\\).) We must abandon the idea that this external cause explains only the first member of the chain, since there is no first member, and that the cause is temporally prior to its effect, since there is no first time. Pruss says:\n\nKant’s example of a metal ball continually causing a depression in a soft material shows that simultaneous causation is conceivable. And apart from full or partial reductions of the notion of causation to something like Humean regularity and temporal precedence, I do not think there is much reason to suppose that the cause of a temporal effect must even be in time. {% cite Craig2009 %}\n\n(I am not sure exactly what is meant by the last line.) Thus, the cause would have to, in some way, “support” the chain such that if the cause did not exist, the chain would not exist. This is confusing and deserves more thought."

    "section": "2. Weaker explanatory principles",
    "text": "2. Weaker explanatory principles\nPruss & Rasmussen utilize a more modest explanatory principle to argue for the existence of a necessary being in their book Necessary Existence. They start with the traditional argument from contingency {% cite PrussRasmussen2018 %}.\n\nFor any contingent concrete things, there is an explanation of the fact that those things exist.\nConsidering all the contingent concrete things that exist, if there is an explanation of the fact that those things exist, then there is a necessary concrete thing.\n(Therefore) There is a necessary concrete being.\n\nHere, “concrete” means “possibly causes something”, i.e., not an abstract object like the number two. This explanatory principle is not as strong as the PSR because it is restricted to facts about existence, so it is not affected by, say, the possibility of unexplained free actions.{% fn 7 %}\nThe authors note a few strengths of this argument: it is defensible against traditional objections from Hume {% cite Hume1779 %} and Kant {% cite Kant1787 %}, it is adaptable to a variety of metaphysical frameworks, and the basic reasoning behind the argument is simple and intuitive {% cite PrussRasmussen2018 %}. The authors also note a few weaknesses of the argument: it does not allow explanatory loops, it does not allow completely internal explanations, and it does not allow any exceptions to the explanatory principle. This last weakness is the most concerning due to the possibility of chancy events. Although indeterministic/statistical explanations are on the table, some people may not think that these are adequate explanations and will insist that, if there are chancy events, chancy events are unexplained.\nTo overcome these weaknesses, the authors introduce several modal arguments. Recall from the discussion of ontological arguments that it is mostly accepted that “possibly necessary” is equivalent to “necessary”. Thus, if it can be shown that a necessary being possibly exists, then it follows that a necessary being exists. We will focus only on the first argument in the book, which Leon {% cite Oppy2019 %} rewrites as:\n\nNormally, things that can begin to exist can have a cause of the beginning of their existence.\nContingent concrete reality can begin to exist.\nTherefore, there can be a cause of the beginning of contingent concrete reality’s existence.\nIf there can be a cause of the beginning of contingent concrete reality’s existence, then a necessary being exists.\nTherefore, a necessary being exists.\n\nThe primary advantage of this argument is the weakening of the explanatory principle (first premise). This premise is more difficult to reject. It allows for exceptions such as uncaused contingent beings, explanatory loops, and internal explanations. As Leon notes, this allows the principle to be used as a defeasible rule of thumb. Referring to Koons {% cite Koons2017 %}, Leon writes “To avoid the demands of a well-supported defeasible principle, one must give principled grounds for thinking that it admits of an exception in the particular case at stake.” {% cite Oppy2019 %}. (There is debate about whether the PSR should be used as a defeasible rule of thumb — see {% cite Koons1997 %}, {% cite Oppy1999 %}, and {% cite Koons2001 %}.)\nThe second premise is more controversial. In support of this premise, Rasmussen & Pruss suggest three approaches. First, one might argue that contingent concrete reality began to exist; this is the task of the Kalam argument. Second, one might argue only that it is plausible that contingent concrete reality began to exist; for example, by finding a viable cosmological model in which time begins or by showing that causal finitism is possibly true. Third, one might argue that it is conceivable that contingent concrete reality began to exist, which provides defeasible evidence of possibility.\nThe primary critique of the second premise is that it is false if origin essentialism is true. On origin essentialism, if we look at our universe, the possible worlds shrink: in our universe, it is either true in all possible worlds, or false in all possible worlds, that contingent concrete reality began to exist. Thus, the word “can” should be removed from the second premise. The authors give several responses to this objection. The first response is a short argument against origin essentialism. The second response is a possible workaround, maintaining origin essentialism. Since origin essentialism is a new concept to me, I will have to return to this discussion some other time.\nThe fourth premise follows from possibly necessary \\(\\rightarrow\\) necessary. Leon offers an alternative to a necessary being; he raises the possibility of factually necessary beings:\n\nPerhaps matter-energy (or whatever matter-energy is ultimately composed) is a factually necessary being. According to such a scenario, the contingent dependent beings (e.g., rocks, trees, planets, you and I, etc.) come into being when two or more contingent independent beings (i.e., factually necessary beings) are combined, and the contingent dependent beings cease to exist when they decompose into their elements. However, the fundamental elements of which contingent dependent beings are composed (i.e., the contingent independent beings/factually necessary beings) cannot pass away, for they are at least de facto indestructible—i.e., nothing in the actual world has what it takes to knock them out of existence. Nor can they be created, for they are eternal, existentially independent, and (assuming origin essentialism and their being uncaused at the actual world) essentially uncaused. {% cite Oppy2019 %}\n\nI am not sure the reason for this distinction. Why not just say that matter-energy is necessary?\nAnother worry for any of these modal arguments is the existence of parody arguments.{% fn 8 %} Oppy constructs a parody argument for every argument in Necessary Existence in his review of the book {% cite Oppy2019-OPPARP %}."

    "text": "3. Conclusion\nOppy has a nice summary of the stances one can take about the foundations/origins of the universe:\n\nSome philosophers suppose that every possible world shares laws and initial causal history with the actual world. Those philosophers divide into two camps: those who suppose that there is just one possible world; and those who suppose that there are many possible worlds. Philosophers in the first camp suppose that causal laws are deterministic; philosophers in the second camp suppose that causal laws are not deterministic. One thing that these philosophers have in common is that they suppose that, if there is an initial causal state, then that initial causal state, and anything that exists in that initial causal state, is necessary: if these philosophers are naturalists, then they suppose that the initial natural state is necessary; if these philosophers are theists, then they suppose that the initial divine state is necessary. Of course, other philosophers suppose that, if there is an initial causal state, then that initial causal state is contingent; and these philosophers divide further on the question of whether there is anything that exists in the initial state that is necessary. It is to be expected that what philosophers have to say about the kinds of arguments that Pruss and Rasmussen discuss is determined by their background views about modality, causation, ontology, epistemology, axiology, and so forth. {% cite Oppy2019-OPPARP %}\n\nIntuitions clash. For example, physicist Sean Carroll says, “I think that brute facts are things we need to accept; the universe is probably one of them.” {% cite Carroll2016 %}. Perhaps all these options are equally strange, but the idea that the only explanation of the universe is brute contingency seems the most strange to me.\nNon-theists can claim that there is a concrete necessary being (or beings); possible candidates are the universe, fields, particles, etc. In this sense, theists and non-theists can agree on some aspects of the fundamental structure reality. Theists have an additional belief: that there is only one concrete necessary being that has properties consistent with those traditionally ascribed to God. The question thus arises: is there any way to choose between these views? This question needs to be treated on its own, separate from the cosmological argument.\n\n{{ ‘We are referred to Oppy’s book Philosophical Perspectives on Infinity for a detailed treatment of the PSR.

The solution to this equation was derived by George William Hill in 1886 to study lunar motion, and for this reason, it is known as Hill’s equation. It also finds application in areas such as condensed matter physics, quantum optics, and accelerator physics.

    "text": "Particle accelerators as parametric oscillators\nParticle accelerators are machines that produce groups of charged particles (beams), increase their kinetic energy, and guide them to a target. These machines are invaluable to modern scientific research. The most famous examples are colliders, such as the LHC, in which two beams are smashed together to generate fundamental particles.\n\n\n\nFig. 1. A detector at an interaction point in the LHC.\n\n\nA lesser known fact is that the fields of condensed matter physics, material science, chemistry, and biology also benefit tremendously from accelerators; this is due to the effectiveness of scattering experiments in which the deflection of a beam after colliding with a target is used to learn information about the target. The scattered beam is composed of neutrons in spallation neutron sources such as SNS, electrons in electron scattering facilities such as CEBAF, or photons in synchrotron light sources such as APS. In addition to scientific research, accelerators find use in medicine, particularly for cancer treatment, and also in various industrial applications.\nThere are generally a few beam properties that are very important to experimentalists; in colliders, it is the energy and luminosity, in spallation sources, it is the intensity, and in light sources, it is the brightness. There is thus a constant need to push these parameters to new regions. For example, below is the famous Livingston plot which shows the energy achieved by various machines over the past century.\n\n\n\nFig. 2. Accelerator energy over time. The vertical axis is not the center of mass energy (CME) — it is the beam energy needed to produce the CME by collision with a resting proton. (source: Rasmus Ischebeck).\n\n\nThere are many physics issues associated with the optimization of these beam parameters. Accelerator physics is a field of applied physics that studies these issues. The task of the accelerator physicist is to understand, control, and measure the journey of the beam from its creation to its final destination. The difficulty of this task has grown over time; the improvement in accelerator performance has brought with it a staggering increase in size and complexity. The construction and operation of modern accelerators generally require years of planning, thousands of scientists and engineers, and hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. Despite this complexity, the underlying physics principles are quite simple, and the single particle motion in one of these machines can be understood analytically if a few approximations are made. In the end, we will arrive at Hill’s equation.\nThere are three basic tasks an accelerator has to accomplish. First, it must increase the beam energy (acceleration). Second, it must guide the beam along a predetermined path (steering). Third, it must ensure the beam particles remain close together (focusing). It is helpful to use a coordinate system in which the s axis points along the design trajectory, and the x and y axes defined in the plane transverse to s. In this way, the motion is broken up into transverse and longitudinal dynamics.\n\n\n\nFig. 3. Curvilinear coordinate system used to describe particle motion along a reference trajectory.\n\n\nHow are these tasks accomplished? Well, particles are charged, and the force on a point charge in an electromagnetic field is given by\n\\[\n\\mathbf{F} = q\\left({\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}}\\right),\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwhere \\(q\\) is the particle charge, \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is the particle velocity, \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) is the electric field, and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is the magnetic field. An accelerator consists of a series of elements, each with their own \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\); the collection of these elements is called a lattice. We need to determine which electric and magnetic fields to use.\nThe first task, acceleration, is not the focus of this post. The remaining tasks, steering and focusing, concern the motion in the transverse plane. \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) fields, not \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) fields, are used since their effect grows with increased particle velocity. Any transverse magnetic field \\(\\mathbf{B} = (B_x, B_y)^T\\) can be written using a multipole expansion\n\\[\nB_y - iB_x = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left({b_n - ia_n}\\right)\\left(\\frac{x + iy}{r_0}\\right)^{n-1}.\n\\tag{3}\\]\nWe then have the normal multiple coefficients \\(\\{b_n\\}\\), and the skew multipole coefficients \\(\\{a_n\\}\\). The field lines corresponding to the first few terms are shown below.\n\n\n\nFig. 4. Multipole expansion of the magnetic field.\n\n\nThe dipole field \\(\\mathbf{B} \\propto \\hat{y}\\) is perfect for steering, producing the force \\(\\mathbf{F} \\propto -\\hat{x}\\) for a particle moving into the page. The quadrupole field \\(\\mathbf{B} \\propto y\\hat{x} + x\\hat{y}\\) produces the force \\(\\mathbf{F}_{quad} \\propto -x\\hat{x} + y\\hat{y}\\), which is focusing in the horizontal direction, but defocusing in the vertical direction; however, net focusing can still be achieved by alternating the direction of the quadrupoles. This is analogous to a beam of light passing through a series of converging and diverging lenses. If the spacing and curvature of the lenses are correctly chosen, net focusing can be achieved.\n\n\n\nFig. 5. Single-particle motion in the thin-lense approximation.\n\n\nThe forces which result from these fields are linear, meaning they are proportional the \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) but not \\(x^2\\), \\(y^3\\), etc., and they are uncoupled, meaning the dynamics in the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) dimensions are independent. Now, we may ask, can we produce a perfect dipole or quadrupole field? The answer is no. In reality, there will always be higher order multipoles present in the field, but people work very hard to ensure these are much smaller than the desired multipole. This video shows a bit of the construction process for these magnets.\nFor small oscillations, the equations of motion reduce to\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    x'' \\approx -\\frac{q}{mc \\beta_s \\gamma_s} B_y(x, y, s), \\\\\n    y'' \\approx +\\frac{q}{mc \\beta_s \\gamma_s} B_x(x, y, s),\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{4}\\]\nwhere \\(x' = dx/ds\\), \\(m\\) is the particle mass, \\(c\\) is the speed of light in a vacuum, \\(\\beta_s\\) is the particle speed divided by \\(c\\), and \\(\\gamma_s = (1 - \\beta_s^2)^{-1/2}\\). (For simplicity, the curved coordinate system has not been taken into account). We will ignore nonlinear terms since they greatly complicate the dynamics. We will also ignore coupling between the planes. With these approximations, we arrive at the equation of motion for a single particle in the transverse plane:\n\\[\nx'' + k(s)x = 0.\n\\tag{5}\\]\nThis is Hill’s equation (Equation 1)."

    "text": "Solving Hill’s equation\nThe general solution to Hill’s equation is given by\n\\[\nx(s) = \\sqrt{2J}\\,w(s) \\cos\\left({\\mu(s) + \\delta}\\right).\n\\tag{6}\\]\nThis introduces an amplitude \\(w(s) = w(s + L)\\) which we call the envelope function, as well as a phase \\(\\mu\\), both of which depend on \\(s\\). The constants \\(J\\) and \\(\\delta\\) are determined by the initial conditions. Let’s plot this trajectory in a FODO (focus-off-defocus-off) lattice, which consists of evenly spaced focusing and defocusing quadrupoles. Here is the focusing strength within the lattice (QF is the focusing quadrupole and QD is the defocusing quadrupole):\n\n\n\nFig. 6. FODO lattice.\n\n\nFor now we can think of the lattice as repeating itself forever in the \\(s\\) direction. Each black line below is represents the trajectory for a different initial position and slope; although the individual trajectories look rather complicated, the envelope function has a very simple form.\n\n\n\nFig. 7. Envelope function and particle trajectories.\n\n\nThe particle motion becomes much easier to interpret if we observe it in position-momentum space, aka phase space. The following animation shows the evolution of the particle phase space coordinates at a single position in the lattice. The position shown is \\(s = nL/4\\), where \\(n\\) is the period number, which corresponds to the midpoint between the focusing and defocusing quadrupoles.\n\n\n\nFig. 8. Phase space coordinates after every focusing period.\n\n\nThe particle jumps around an ellipse in phase space. The shape and orientation of the ellipse will change if we look at a different position in the lattice, but its area will be the same. So, the motion is determined by the dimensions and oriention of this ellipse throughout the lattice, as well as the location of the particle on the ellipse boundary. This motivates the definition of the so-called Twiss parameters, which were first introduced by Courant and Snyder in 1958:\n\\[\n\\beta = w^2, \\quad \\alpha = -\\frac{1}{2}\\beta', \\quad \\gamma = \\frac{1 + \\alpha^2}{\\beta}.\n\\tag{7}\\]\nThe dimensions of the phase space ellipse are nicely described by these parameters:\n\n\n\nFig. 9. Courant-Snyder ellipse.\n\n\nThe maximum extent of the ellipse is determined by \\(\\beta\\) in the \\(x\\) direction and \\(\\gamma\\) in the \\(y\\) direction. \\(\\alpha\\) is proportional to the slope of the \\(\\beta\\) function, and so determines the tilt angle of the ellipse. The position of a particle on the ellipse is given by the phase \\(\\mu\\). Finally, the invariant of the motion corresponding to the ellipse area is proportional to \\(2J = \\beta {x'}^2 + 2\\alpha xx' + \\gamma x^2\\) for any \\(x\\) and \\(x'\\). The \\(\\beta\\) functions and phase advances in both dimensions are extremely important to measure and control in a real machine.\nA helpful tool to pair with the parameterization we just introduced is the transfer matrix, a matrix which connects the phase space coordinates at two different positions:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ x' \\end{bmatrix}_{s + L}\n= \\mathbf{M}\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ x' \\end{bmatrix}_{s}\n\\tag{8}\\]\nThe transfer matrix can be written as \\(\\mathbf{M} = \\mathbf{V}\\mathbf{P}\\mathbf{V}^{-1}\\), where\n\\[\\mathbf{V} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}} \\begin{bmatrix} \\beta & 0 \\\\ -\\alpha & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\] and \\[\n\\mathbf{P} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  \\cos\\mu & \\sin\\mu \\\\ -\\sin\\mu & \\cos\\mu\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe effect of \\(\\mathbf{V}^{-1}\\) is to deform the phase space ellipse into a circle while preserving its area. \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) is then just a rotation in phase space, and \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) then transforms back into a tilted ellipse. This is illustrated below. \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) can be thought of as a time-dependent transformation which removes the variance in the focusing strength, turning the parametric oscillator into a simple harmonic oscillator. It is often called the Floquet transformation.\n\n\n\nFig. 10. Effect of the Floquet transformation on the Courant-Snyder ellipse."

    "text": "Conclusion\nWe’ve presented the solution to Hill’s equation, which describes a parameteric oscillator. The equation pops up in multiple areas, but we focused on its application in accelerator physics, in which Hill’s equation describes the transverse motion of a single particle in an accelerator with perfectly linear magnetic fields.\nThe solution is best understood geometrically: particles move around the surface of an ellipse in phase space, the area of which is an invariant of the motion. The dimensions and orientation of the ellipse are determined by \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\), and the location of the particle on the ellipse boundary is determined by \\(\\mu\\). These parameters can be used to construct a time-dependent transformation (\\(\\mathbf{V}\\)) which turns the parametric oscillator into a simple harmonic oscillator.\nThe next post will examine how this treatment can be extended to include coupling between the horizontal and vertical dimensions."
